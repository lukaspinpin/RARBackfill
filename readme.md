# Backfill RAR Simulation Code

This repository contains the R code (`backfill_RAR_simulation_code.R`) necessary to replicate the results presented in the paper "Implementing and assessing Bayesian response-adaptive randomisation for backfilling in dose-finding trials" by Pin et al. The code provides an in-depth look into the Bayesian response-adaptive randomisation (RAR) methodology applied to dose-finding trials, focusing on backfilling scenarios.

## About the Paper

The paper by Pin et al. introduces a novel approach to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of dose-finding clinical trials through Bayesian RAR. The specific focus on backfilling eight differen scenarios provides critical insights and strategies for dose-finding trial designs.

### Prerequisites

Before you run the simulation code, ensure you have R installed on your computer.
